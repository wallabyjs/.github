## Hi there 👋 🦘

We're [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com), a team of software engineers who are passionate about creating software development tools.

At Wallaby, we believe that we should only create products that we ourselves use on a daily basis. This allows us to truly understand our users and feel the same pains that they do so that we can invent and innovate on their behalf.

### Our projects
:kangaroo: [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com) is a developer productivity tool that runs your JavaScript and TypeScript tests immediately as you type, highlighting results in your IDE right next to your code.

:hamster: [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com) runs JavaScript and TypeScript with instant feedback. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your editor next to your code, as you type.

🐱‍👤 [Console Ninja](https://console-ninja.com) displays `console.log` output and **runtime errors** directly in your editor from your running browser or node application. 
 
:tv: [Codeclip](https://codeclip.io) shares a recording of your code execution and output

:dog2: [Dingo](https://wallabyjs.com/dingo) is a VS Code extension that allows you to download, install and open git repos and the source code for npm packages from the comfort of your editor.
